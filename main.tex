\copyrightinfo{\url{https://github.com/tdwiser/physhandout}} %sets a (global) bottom-right footer. Can be set inside a handout BUT carries over to following handouts
% \problemname{...} %changes the `Problem #' text to `... #' when you \begin{problem}...\end{problem}

\inithandout{lecture}{Lecture} % creates a new type of handout, a Lecture, which can be invoked with \begin{lecture}...\end{lecture}

\onlyactivity{sample_activity} % only produce sample_activity, nothing else
% \onlypset{} % if you leave out an \only, they will all be made

\begin{document}

\begin{activity}[lame_activity]{A Lame Activity}
	We don't want this activity show up in the pdf file, so it's not listed in the \verb|\onlyactivity{}| command above.
\end{activity}

\begin{activity}[sample_activity]{A Sample Activity}
	Here is the \LaTeX code for this sample activity, which is automatically numbered (this is Activity~\ref{activity:sample_activity}; note that Activity~\ref{activity:lame_activity} can still be \verb|\ref|'d even though it isn't in this file).
	
	You could also \verb|\input{file.tex}| here instead to keep things clean (recommended!)
\end{activity}

\begin{pset}[ps1]{A Problem Set}
	This Problem Set (which is number~\ref{pset:ps1}, numbered independently from the activities, etc.) will show up in the pdf file because there is no \verb|\onlypset{}| command to tell it not to.
\end{pset}
